      <summary>Character map grouping method</summary>
      <description>
        This is how the characters in the character map are grouped.
        The characters can either be grouped by 'script' or 'block'.

    <key name='font' type='ms'>
      <summary>Character map font description</summary>
      <description>
        The font to use for the character map.  If set to 'nothing' then
        the default is the system font with the size doubled.  Otherwise
        it should be a font description string like 'Sans 24'.

      <description>
        The number of columns in the character map grid is determined by
        the width of the window.  If this setting is 'true' then the
        value will be forced to the nearest power of two.

      <description>
        This is the last character that was selected in the character
        map (and will be selected again when the character map is next
        started).

        By default, it is the first letter of the alphabet in the current
        locale.
