 - Get all the information in the caption. [DONE]

 - Navigate by unicode block and codepoint (GtkTreeView on the right?) [DONE]

 - Scrollbar on the tabulus [DONE]

 - Move up and down one row at a time in the tabulus [DONE]

 - Figure out something good for resizing and stuff [DONE]

 - Maybe change the keyboard and mouse navigation to do prelight stuff;
   only blue when you click or press enter or whatever?

 - Text to copy: can do this like gnome-character-map [DONE]

 - Paste to jump to a character [DONE]

 - Accessibility stuff, see 
   http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gap/guide/gad/index.html

 - Magnify active character, as in windows charmap?


For the next release after 0.2 (0.3? 1.0?):

 - Pull the search and text-to-copy out of the charmap widget.

 - Do all the text direction stuff, including connecting to that
   direction-changed signal. In a RTL locale, U+0000 should be in the
   upper right.

 - Replace bootstrap with autogen.sh.

 - Write the shell script that automates generation of the source
   files that are based on uincode.org information. Make it part of
   the build process?? Maybe the autogen process...

 - Do something about accessibility. This might mean having the
   charmap implement AtkTable as suggested by hp.

 - Handle --version, --help, etc., even when built without gnome.

 - Add a --disable-gnome option to the configury. [DONE]

 - Accels for some of the menu items.

 - Use keynav from theme with GtkBindingSet.


Other future things, perhaps to be in 0.3, perhaps not:

 - Think about sending signals and messages instead of exporting the
   statusbar widget.

 - Fix the mini_fontsel quirks and bugs.

 - Write gtk docs for the charmap and mini_fontsel widgets.

 - Find out about strangenesses (like the list of DnD targets) and fix
   them if appropriate.

 - Think about the search; should it find computed hangul syllables,
   etc?

 - Write or solicit some help. The F1 kind.
 
 - Unicode annotations and cross references (suggested by Markus Kuhn).
